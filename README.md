# eCommerce

##this is a eCommerce project, you could learn the code and implementation in src dict.

##the frontend is using jquery and bootstrap. Maybe refactor it using react + redux in the future.

##the backend is using spring + springmvc + mybatis + mysql. It could handle high concurrency and remain efficiency at same time
